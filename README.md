# <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/548da441-e718-4647-912b-ef3ddd34ba61" width="250"> Parallel Active Learning - automated, modular, and parallel active learning workflow
Parallel active learning (PAL) workflow with data and task parallelism through Message Passing Interface (MPI) and mpi4py.


## Features
* The automatic workflow reduces human intervention in active learning.
* The machine learning training (ML) and inference processes are decoupled, enabling data and task parallelism for data generation, labeling, and training tasks.
* PAL is designed in a modular and highly adaptive fashion that can be extended to different tasks with various combinations of resources, data, and ML model types.
* Implemented with MPI and its Python package (mpi4py), PAL is scalable and can be deployed flexibly on shared- (e.g., laptop) and distributed-memory systems (e.g., computer cluster).

## Prerequisite
* Python >= 3.10
* mpi4py >= 3.1 with openmpi
* Numpy
* openmpi == 4.1

## Usage
The usage of PAL consists of implementation of processes in four kernels (``Generator``, ``Prdiction``, ``Oracle``, and ``Training``). During execution, a number of instances specified in ``al_setting`` of each kernel are created and executed in parallel. For communication efficiency, data transferred among kernels should be arranged as 1-D ``Numpy`` numerical arrays.
* Generator: receive prediction from the Prediction kernel and generate new data.
* Prediction: make predictions on the data generated by processes in the Generator kernel.
* Oracle: provide ground truth labels for the data selected by the user-defined ``prediction_check()`` function.
* Training: train ML models on the labeled data generated by processes in the Oracle kernel.
* Utils: ``prediction_check()`` selects data sent to Oracle for labeling and data sent to Generator for next data generation step, based on the predictions from the Prediction kernel. ``adjust_input_for_oracle()`` re-evaluates the data waiting to be labeled based on the most up-to-date ML model for higher efficiency (Controlled by ``dynamic_orcale_list`` in ``al_setting``).

### Run PAL for excited states molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
Employ PAL to enable the simulation of multiple excited-state potential energy surfaces of a small molecule organic semiconductor, where fully connected neural networks implemented with NNsForMD (https://github.com/aimat-lab/NNsForMD) are utilized in Prediction and Training kernels to predict the ground-state energy and excited-state energy levels. The processes in the Generator kernel propagate MD trajectories and generate new atomic coordinates with PyRAI2MD developed by Jingbai Li et al (https://github.com/lopez-lab/PyRAI2MD). In the oracle kernel, accurate energy and force labels are computed using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory with TURBOMOLE (https://www.turbomole.org/).

Install packages. Note this will also install NNsForMD and PyRAI2MD packages modified specifically for this project.
